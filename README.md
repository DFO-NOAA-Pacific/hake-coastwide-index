# hake-coastwide-index

This repository represents a demonstration of using the `surveyjoin` R package, also part of this organization. The example involves joining together trawl survey data from Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) with trawl survey data collected by NOAA Fisheries (Northwest Fisheries Science Center) to generate a coastwide index of Pacific hake.
